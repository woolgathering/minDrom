Total samples in the file: 8877055 (44100 * totalDur)

Total frames: 5031 @ 25fps




//////
Samples per frame:

totalSamples/totalFrames

8877055/5031 = 1764.4712780759 samples per frame

--->> how to deal with fractions of samples?? Rounding, I'm sure...

Taken to the next power of two; 2048 with zero padding. Each shoud be loaded into a buffer and operated on individually. 
Code is something like this:

spf = samples per frame (1764.47...)

samples = (spf*frameNum).round(1)

then copy those frames to a buffer that is:

buffer = Signal.new(samples.nextPowOfTwo) // syntax is wrong but you get the idea
// then copy the values in samples to buffer. Zero padding is automatic. Boom!
